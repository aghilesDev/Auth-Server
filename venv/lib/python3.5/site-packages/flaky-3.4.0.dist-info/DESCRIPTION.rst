        About
        -----
        
        Flaky is a plugin for nose or py.test that automatically reruns flaky tests.
        
        Ideally, tests reliably pass or fail, but sometimes test fixtures must rely on components that aren't 100%
        reliable. With flaky, instead of removing those tests or marking them to @skip, they can be automatically
        retried.
        
        For more information about flaky, see `this presentation <http://opensource.box.com/flaky/>`_.
        
        Marking tests flaky
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To mark a test as flaky, simply import flaky and decorate the test with @flaky:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from flaky import flaky
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            @flaky
            def test_something_that_usually_passes(self):
                value_to_double = 21
                result = get_result_from_flaky_doubler(value_to_double)
                self.assertEqual(result, value_to_double * 2, 'Result doubled incorrectly.')
        
        By default, flaky will retry a failing test once, but that behavior can be overridden by passing values to the
        flaky decorator. It accepts two parameters: max_runs, and min_passes; flaky will run tests up to max_runs times, until
        it has succeeded min_passes times. Once a test passes min_passes times, it's considered a success; once it has been
        run max_runs times without passing min_passes times, it's considered a failure.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            @flaky(max_runs=3, min_passes=2)
            def test_something_that_usually_passes(self):
                """This test must pass twice, and it can be run up to three times."""
                value_to_double = 21
                result = get_result_from_flaky_doubler(value_to_double)
                self.assertEqual(result, value_to_double * 2, 'Result doubled incorrectly.')
        
        Marking a class flaky
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In addition to marking a single test flaky, entire test cases can be marked flaky:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            @flaky
            class TestMultipliers(TestCase):
                def test_flaky_doubler(self):
                    value_to_double = 21
                    result = get_result_from_flaky_doubler(value_to_double)
                    self.assertEqual(result, value_to_double * 2, 'Result doubled incorrectly.')
        
                @flaky(max_runs=3)
                def test_flaky_tripler(self):
                    value_to_triple = 14
                    result = get_result_from_flaky_tripler(value_to_triple)
                    self.assertEqual(result, value_to_triple * 3, 'Result tripled incorrectly.')
        
        The @flaky class decorator will mark test_flaky_doubler as flaky, but it won't override the 3 max_runs
        for test_flaky_tripler (from the decorator on that test method).
        
        Don't rerun certain types of failures
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Depending on your tests, some failures are obviously not due to flakiness. Instead of rerunning
        after those failures, you can specify a filter function that can tell flaky to fail the test right away.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            def is_not_crash(err, *args):
                return not issubclass(err[0], ProductCrashedError)
        
            @flaky
            def test_something():
                raise ProductCrashedError
        
            @flaky(rerun_filter=is_not_crash)
            def test_something_else():
                raise ProductCrashedError
        
        Flaky will run `test_something` twice, but will only run `test_something_else` once.
        
        It can also be used to incur a delay between test retries:
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            import time
            
            def delay_rerun(*args):
                time.sleep(1)
                return True
            
            @flaky(rerun_filter=delay_rerun)
            def test_something_else():
                ...
        
        Activating the plugin
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Like any nose plugin, flaky can be activated via the command line:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            nosetests --with-flaky
        
        With py.test, flaky will automatically run. It can, however be disabled via the command line:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            py.test -p no:flaky
        
        Command line arguments
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        No Flaky Report
        +++++++++++++++
        
        Pass ``--no-flaky-report`` to suppress the report at the end of the run detailing flaky test results.
        
        Shorter Flaky Report
        ++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Pass ``--no-success-flaky-report`` to suppress information about successful flaky tests.
        
        Force Flaky
        +++++++++++
        
        Pass ``--force-flaky`` to treat all tests as flaky.
        
        Pass ``--max-runs=MAX_RUNS`` and/or ``--min-passes=MIN_PASSES`` to control the behavior of flaky if ``--force-flaky``
        is specified. Flaky decorators on individual tests will override these defaults.
        
        
        *Additional usage examples are in the code - see test/test_example.py*
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install, simply:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            pip install flaky
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Flaky is tested with the following test runners and options:
        
        - Nosetests. Doctests cannot be marked flaky.
        
        - Py.test. Works with `pytest-xdist` but not with the `--boxed` option. Doctests cannot be marked flaky.
